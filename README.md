## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**PiniPinella/PiniPinella** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on becoming a data analyst
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, SQL, Power BI and advanced Excel skills
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m not quite comfortable with hanling GitHub yet, but I'm working on it.
