## 👋 Hi, I'm Laura!

I'm a future data analyst with a deep passion for Python, data wrangling, and solving real-world problems through clean, structured insights.

💡 **What drives me?**  
Curiosity, creativity, and the constant urge to understand the "why" behind data. I bring a unique perspective from my background in healthcare and psychology, which fuels my obsession with patterns—both in human behavior and in data.

🔍 **Currently diving deep into:**  
- 🐍 Python (especially pandas, NumPy, matplotlib & Streamlit)
- 🧠 SQL (for structured data querying & analysis)
- 📊 Power BI (for intuitive dashboards)
- 📈 Advanced Excel (with an analytical mindset)

🛠️ **Projects I'm proud of:**  
📝 I love building practical tools, like custom to-do apps with database backends or exploring public datasets for hidden trends. *(More in my pinned repos!)*
🌍 Right now, my projects are mostly in German because I’m working with my classmates — but I’m fluent in English and excited to expand into English-speaking collaborations soon.
